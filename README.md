- I'm @confaw (Connor Fawcett)
- I currently work alongside Dr. Qing Zhao at Northeastern University studying catalysis. My work is computational and focused on electrochemical systems.
- I'm currently learning about using ASE and VASP to optimize atomic structures.
- If you have any questions on my codes you can reach me at fawcett.co@northeastern.edu
- Please, remember I'm a chemical engineer by trade- not a computer scientist. Forgive me if I have a lack of technical coding knowledge, or sloppy python files.
